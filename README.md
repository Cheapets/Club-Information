## Description

The point of this club is to inspire interest in web applications.

The Web Development Club was started by a group of individuals with both professional and personal experience in all different parts of a full stack web application from creating a database, to building a REST API, to styling with CSS. An average day in the club may include; a short code along to learn how to make a real time chat room with Socket.io/Node.js or a simple blog site using Python/Django/MySQL. There will also be time to work on side/school projects in an environment of like-minded people.

We are planning on attending various meet-ups/conferences in Boston, hosting in-house hackathons, and getting speakers from the industry to talk to our club.

Students from all backgrounds are welcome.
