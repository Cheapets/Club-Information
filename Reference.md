## Install a Text Editor
##### What is this?
You should have a basic text editor installed in order to follow along with code tutorials and for your own personal work. We have some recommendations below, but feel free to research online to find one you like.

* ##### [Atom](https://atom.io) (Our Recommendation)
Atom is super easy to use, clean, hackable, and made by Github. It's what most of us program with and is a great choice.

* ##### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* ##### [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

* ##### [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

## Install Git
##### What is this?
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

It is really important to understand and be comfortable with Git in order to be successful in the world of modern software development.

### Installation
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

### Setup a Github account
Head over to this URL, https://github.com/join, and make a Github account in order to download the starter code for in-club code alongs.



Now go to this URL, https://github.com/UML-WebDev/Club-Information, (where you are now) and "star" this repo and press "watch" to be notified when changes are made.

## Install Node and NPM
#### What is this?
Node is a runtime which allows you to use Javascript on the back end of your application (to create servers, APIs, command line tools, etc.).

NPM (node package manager) is included in the Node install. This will allow you to download packages (libraries, frameworks, etc.) to use in your Javascript applications.
